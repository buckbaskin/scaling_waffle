class NaivePotential(Potential):

    An implementation of the Potential class/algorithm that assumes the only
    obstacles that exist are those it can see.

    This will likely fail without a 360 degree scan, because it will only see
    obstacles in front of it, which would "push" it backwards.

class SavingPotential(Potential):

    An implementation of the Potential class/algorithm that keeps track of all
    of the points that it has seen a laser return from.

    This will likely fail with dynamic obstacles, because it will still see old
    obstacles even if a laser scan has shown the obstacle to have moved. With
    static obstacles, this should outperform the NaivePotential.
